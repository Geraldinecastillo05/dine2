    <h2><center> Same old Love </h2>

        <ul> 
           <h3>Verse 1:</h3> Take away your things and go
You can't take back what you said, I know
I've heard it all before, at least a million times
I'm not one to forget, you know
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
Right now

           <h3>Chorus:</h3> I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
            I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
            I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)

           <h3>Verse 2:</h3> I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
            I know, I've heard it all
            So don't you try and change your mind
            'Cause I won't be changing too, you know
            You can't believe, still can't believe it
            You left in peace, left me in pieces
            Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees
            Right now
             
           <h3>Chorus:</h3>I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
            I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
            I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
            I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
            I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
            I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
            I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
            I'm so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            I'm so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
            I'm so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
            Oh-oh-oh (that same old love)
